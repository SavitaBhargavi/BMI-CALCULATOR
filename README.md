# BMI-CALCULATOR
A simple Python-based BMI Calculator. The beginner version is a command-line tool that takes weight (kg) and height (m), computes BMI using the formula, and classifies it as underweight, normal, overweight, or obese. A beginner-friendly project to learn user input, validation, and basic Python logic.
🎯 Objective

Create a BMI Calculator in Python that helps users assess their body mass index and health category.

Basic Version: Calculates BMI and classifies it into standard categories.

Advanced Version: Adds a GUI interface, input validation, BMI history tracking, and trend visualization.

🛠️ Steps Performed
🔹 Basic Version

Collected user input for weight (kg) and height (m).

Calculated BMI:

BMI = weight / (height^2)


Categorized BMI: Underweight, Normal weight, Overweight, Obese.

Displayed the result to the user.

🔹 Advanced Version

Developed a Tkinter GUI for user-friendly interaction.

Added input validation and error handling for invalid entries.

Stored BMI history for the session.

Added BMI trend visualization using Matplotlib to show changes over multiple entries.

⚙️ Tools & Technologies Used

Python

Libraries:

tkinter – GUI interface

matplotlib – Plotting BMI trends

messagebox – Error and info dialogs

✅ Outcome

Basic Version: Accurately calculates BMI and categorizes results.

Advanced Version: Enhanced with GUI, error handling, session history, and BMI trend visualization.

Improved user experience and data visualization for better health tracking.


🚀 Future Enhancements

Save BMI history across sessions in a file or database.

Provide personalized health recommendations based on BMI category.

Add unit conversion (e.g., cm/inches, lbs/kg).

Improve GUI with more styling and user-friendly layout
